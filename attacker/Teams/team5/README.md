# CSCE 689

This project is developed as part of the coursework for CSCE689: ML-Based Cyber Defenses. It represents a practical application of machine learning techniques in the domain of cybersecurity, aiming to identify, analyze, and defend against cyber threats using data-driven approaches.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.10 or newer)
- Docker
- Conda (optional, but highly recommended for managing Python environments)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone hhttps://github.com/jwonnyleaf/csce689-competition.git
  cd defender
```

### Setup Virtual Environment

You can skip this step if you're using Docker to run the project.

If using `conda` (recommended):

```bash
conda create --name defender-app python=3.6.4
conda activate defender-app
```

Or using Python's built in `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r docker-requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application with Docker

To containerize the application and run it using Docker

1. Build the Docker image
   ```bash
   docker build -t defender-app .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container

   ```bash
   docker run -itp 8080:8080 defender-app
   ```

   The -p 8080:8080 flag maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host, allowing you to access the application via http://localhost:8080.

3. Verify the Docker/Installation
   `bash
 curl http://localhost:8080/hello
 `
   You should receive a "Hello, World!" response if everything is set up correctly.


### Training the Model

To train a model and have it saved to /models... navigate to /notebooks where the training process happens.
Running this Juypter Notebook will train a very basic model and save it to the project.


### Running Classification

Make sure you've follow the Running the Application with Docker process mentioned earlier. If so you can now send a cURL request like this...
```bash
curl -XPOST --data-binary @./data/sample/malware/000077419ead44800537b34f5c2137e572c472698a13c39151f90eaabde7c94e.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
```

### Running Test with Provided Test Set
Run the following command to get an output test suite (results.csv)
```bash
python3 test/test.py
```
