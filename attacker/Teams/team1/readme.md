## Malware Detector Readme

This repository contains a Docker image for a Malware Detector. Follow the instructions below to run the Malware Detector using Docker.

### Instructions:

1. **Build the Docker Image**: 

    After launching Docker, navigate to the directory where the project files are located using the command line interface. Then run the following command to build a Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t malware-detector .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

    After building the Docker image, run the following command to start the Docker container:

    ```
    docker run -p 8080:8080 malware-detector
    ```
3. **Make a Prediction**:

    Open another terminal window and run the following curl command to make a prediction, if you are using a UNIX based system:

    ```
    curl -XPOST --data-binary @/path_to_binary/your_binary_file.exe http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
    ```
   Replace `/path_to_binary/your_binary_file.exe` with the actual path to the binary file you want to analyze.


5. **Repeat as Needed**:

    You can repeat the process to analyze multiple binary files by following steps 1 to 3 with different file paths.

### Note:

- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system before proceeding with the above steps.
- The Malware Detector Docker image must be properly loaded and running before making predictions.
- Adjust file paths and ports as necessary based on your system configuration.
